# The Transactional Association Miner API

**Description:**

Effortlessly integrate transactional pattern discovery with the Transactional Pattern API â€“ a lightweight and powerful machine learning tool. Seamlessly mine frequency itemsets from diverse datasets, uncovering valuable insights across domains. Whether it's analyzing online user behavior, discovering associations in e-commerce transactions, or understanding customer preferences in subscription services, this API simplifies predictive insights. With association rule learning at its core, businesses can optimize inventory, refine marketing strategies, and make informed decisions with ease.


## Why Transactional Pattern API?

1. <b>Efficiency</b>: Streamlined for seamless integration, the API minimizes complexity while maximizing performance.

2. <b>Versatility</b>: Adapt the API to various datasets, from supermarket transactions to online user behavior and e-commerce transactions.

3. <b>Optimization</b>: Uncover valuable insights to optimize inventory, tailor marketing strategies, and enhance customer experiences.

4. <b>Predictive Power</b>: Leverage association rule learning to predict item occurrences based on transaction patterns, aiding in informed decision-making.

**How does it work?**

Imagine you are a supermarket eager to decipher consumer behavior. Your dataset comprises receipts given to customers after they pay. Below is a list of five items, each represented by its first letter (e.g., b = beer), and, below that, a list of eight transaction examples. Each transaction, such as {"b", "p"}, signifies items purchased in a single transaction.

The goal is to identify patterns, known as association pairs, in the form of X -> Y. X can either be a single item or a set of items. For instance in the case of a single item, consider X as "beer" and Y as "juice." The objective is to determine if there's a relationship between consumers who buy beer and those who also purchase juice. In the case of item pairs, consider X as an item set, "milk" and "diapers," and Y as "beer." This association pair can be expressed as follows: (Milk, diapers) -> Beers. This form expresses that customers buying milk and diapers are more likely to purchase beers. To extrapolate this association pair, the algorithm needs a confidence metric, measuring how often each item in Y appears in transactions containing items in X. In the following example, the confidence metris is 1/2. Using the milk, diapers, and beers example, the algorithm will search through all transactions with beers in the set and look to see if milk and diapers appear in them. If for all beers purchased half of that set containes milk and diapers, then the algorithm will output (Milk, diapers) -> Beers.

Items:

b = beer
c = coke
p = pepsi
m = milk
j = juice

Transactions:

{"b", "p"}
{"c", "m"}
{"b", "c", "j"}
{"p", "m"}
{"b", "c", "m"}
{"m", "j"}
{"j"}
{"b", "c", "m", "j"}
